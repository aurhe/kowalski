# Kowalski

Kowalski is a in-vehicle display designed for cars that require an efficient use of the available energy during a race. It provides useful information during the race, such as, the ideal lap time automatically adjusted using that race logged times and remaining laps. If a lap takes more time than expected, the app automatically provides the new ideal lap time so that the pilot can adjust the speed accordingly, in order to distribute the energy consumption by the remaining laps.

It was initially developed to be used by the aero@UBI team in Shell Eco-marathon Europe 2014 and is now available to everyone who wants to use it and/or modify to suit their specific needs.

## Features

- Displays useful information during the race: current lap time, current speed, current race time and total race time.
- Calculates the current lap ideal time using stored information of the registered lap times, remaining laps and total race time.
- Displays the logged laps times.
- Provides a wind direction indicator. The wind direction can be configured in the settings menu, and is automatically adjusting during the race using the device compass. The pilot can use this information to adjust the car speed accordingly when the wind is in the same direction as the car or in the opposite direction.
- The race total time is configurable, to allow the team to define the required safety margin.
